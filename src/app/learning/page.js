            <h1>Rules Governing the Use of the Library and Resource Centre</h1>

            <h2 id="reColour">
                All students and staff of the College are entitled to register as members of the Library
                and Resource Centre and to use the facilities for the purpose of their course of study or
                College employment.
                <br /> <br />
                Membership may also be extended to other individuals and to persons nominated from other organisations:
                a fee is usually charged.  Access to the Library and Resource Centre for study purposes may be made
                available to non-members by arrangement. Details are available in the External Services leaflet.
                <br /> <br />
                Use of facilities implies acceptance of the Library and Resource Centre rules printed below.
                These are designed to protect the interests of all users of Library and Resource Centre and to ensure
                that the College operates within the law and can carry out its functions efficiently and effectively.
                The Library and Resource Centre rules apply in principle to all sites, including workstation rooms and
                site libraries, notwithstanding some variations in practice in the site libraries.  Admission to the
                Library and Resource Centre is conditional upon observation of the rules and the staff are empowered
                to enforce them.
                <br /> <br />
                Breaches of the rules may be dealt with by specific Library and Resource Centre Disciplinary Action
                (see below), including the withdrawal of some access, and if appropriate by invoking the College’s
                Regulations for Students, in the case of students, or in the case of staff through the appropriate
                College procedures as set out in the Staff Handbook.

                    Individuals or organisations who are not eligible for membership but have good reason
                    to use the Library and Resource Centre  may be admitted, by arrangement, for purposes
                    of study only. Procedures for seeking admission are outlined in the External Services
                    leaflet. Non-members must sign the Visitors' Book on each visit, and may be required to
                    produce written identification.  Study use does not include access to the College's
                    Academic Network.

                <li>
                    ID cards issued by the College are not transferable from one person to another.
                    The person named on each card is responsible for all items borrowed on it and is
                    liable for the cost of replacement of the card or items borrowed on it in the event
                    of loss or damage.
